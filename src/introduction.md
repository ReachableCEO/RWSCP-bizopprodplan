# Redwood Springs Capital Partners (RWSCP) -  Business/Operations/Product Plan - Introduction

## RWSCP Executive Summary

RWSCP is a ground up re-take on the venture capital model. It invests deeply in :

- hard/deep tech (b2b, b2c, b2g) (partnering deeply with STL)
- Gov tech (b2g) Usually in the hard/deep tech space but not exclusively) (partnering deeply with MerchantsOfHope)

- It is aggresively targeting the following distribution of outcomes:

- 90% full success rate of 20x or more return 
- 5% partial success rate of 5-10x or more return 
- 5% rate of merger/aquisition/acquohire etc (soft landings) (sometimes the product or service is fantastic but the execution is problematic or culture has rotted)

We will accomplish these world class outcomes through:
- having a stadardized pitch package available online and licensed under AGPLv3 (in hopes other firms adopt our value creating/capital growth ways) 
- an extremely proprietary, quantative and qualatative data driven pitch scoring and evaluation system
- unique LP access (a robust roster of (U)HNWI via 20+ years of strategic relationship building)
- unique dealflow access (direct access to a diverse set of patent holders,inventors and amazing second/third degree connections to same)
